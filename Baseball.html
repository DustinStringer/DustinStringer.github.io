  <p>So it was the last ining and I was second to last to bat. it was 6-7 with 1 person on the base. and this was when I was still new and not very good,but I went to the plate scared as all hell. I missed to of the pitches but i stepped out shook I it off and stepped back. He threw a fast ball and I closed my eyes for a split second, swung and hit the ball for left field. i ran to second base while we scored 7-7. Then the last batter hit the ball to first he got out but i ran to home and scored us 8-7 and won the game.</p>
